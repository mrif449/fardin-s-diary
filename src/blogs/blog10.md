## Problem-solving skills (programming)

**Conceptual Questions:**

1.  **Question:** What is the importance of writing clear and concise code?
    *   **Answer:** Clear and concise code is important for readability, maintainability, and collaboration. It makes it easier for other developers (and yourself in the future) to understand, debug, and modify the code. It reduces the likelihood of errors and speeds up the development process.

2.  **Question:** Describe the benefits of breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable parts (decomposition).
    *   **Answer:** Decomposition allows you to tackle complex problems more effectively by focusing on smaller, more isolated aspects. It improves code organization, reduces cognitive load, facilitates testing, and allows for the reuse of solutions to sub-problems.

3.  **Question:** What is debugging, and why is it a critical part of the development process?
    *   **Answer:** Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing errors (bugs) in code. It is critical because it ensures the software functions as intended, provides a good user experience, and prevents unexpected behavior. Without debugging, software will likely have errors and not perform correctly.

4.  **Question:** Explain the concept of an algorithm. Give an example from real life.
    *   **Answer:** An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or set of rules designed to solve a specific problem or accomplish a specific task. Example: A recipe is an algorithm for cooking a dish.

5.  **Question:** What is the difference between syntax errors and logical errors?
    *   **Answer:**
        *   **Syntax errors:** Errors in the grammar of the programming language (e.g., missing semicolon, misspelled keyword).  The code will not compile/run.
        *   **Logical errors:** Errors in the logic of the code that cause it to produce incorrect results, even though it may compile and run without error messages. (e.g., wrong calculation).

**Practical Questions (Code Snippets/Scenarios):**

6.  **Question:** You have an array of numbers `[5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]`. Write code (in any language you're comfortable with - indicate which one) to find the largest number in the array.
    *   **Answer (JavaScript Example):**

        ```javascript
        function findLargest(arr) {
          if (arr.length === 0) {
            return undefined; // Handle empty array case
          }
          let largest = arr[0];
          for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (arr[i] > largest) {
              largest = arr[i];
            }
          }
          return largest;
        }

        const numbers = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6];
        const largestNumber = findLargest(numbers);
        console.log(largestNumber); // Output: 9
        ```

7.  **Question:**  Write a function (in your preferred language) to reverse a string.  For example, if the input is "hello", the output should be "olleh".
    *   **Answer (Python Example):**

        ```python
        def reverse_string(s):
          return s[::-1] # String slicing for reversal
        #Alternative
        #def reverse_string(s):
        #    return "".join(reversed(s))

        print(reverse_string("hello"))  # Output: olleh
        ```

8.  **Question:**  You have a function that is supposed to calculate the area of a rectangle. However, the function is not working correctly. Explain what could be the possible error.
    ```python
    def calculate_rectangle_area(length, width):
        area = length + width #error is here
        return area

    print(calculate_rectangle_area(5, 10))
    ```
    *   **Answer:** The error is in the calculation of the area. It is adding the length and the width, but the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length and the width. The corrected function would be:
    ```python
    def calculate_rectangle_area(length, width):
        area = length * width
        return area

    print(calculate_rectangle_area(5, 10))
    ```

9.  **Question:**  You are given a problem.  Write pseudocode that outlines the steps you would take to solve this problem.

    **Problem:** You need to write a program that checks if a given number is a prime number.  A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

    *   **Answer (Pseudocode Example):**

        ```
        FUNCTION isPrime(number):
          IF number <= 1 THEN
            RETURN FALSE  // Prime numbers are greater than 1
          END IF

          FOR i FROM 2 TO square root of number:  // Optimization: Check up to the square root
            IF number MOD i EQUALS 0 THEN
              RETURN FALSE // It's divisible, so not prime
            END IF
          END FOR

          RETURN TRUE // If no divisors found, it's prime
        END FUNCTION
        ```

## Database Knowledge

**Conceptual Questions:**

1.  **Question:** What is a database? What is the role of a database management system (DBMS)?
    *   **Answer:** A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A DBMS (Database Management System) is software that allows you to create, manage, and interact with databases.  It provides tools for storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting data. Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB.

2.  **Question:** Explain the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases.  Give an example of when you might choose each type.
    *   **Answer:**
        *   **SQL (Relational) Databases:**  Data is stored in tables with a predefined schema (structure).  They use SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying. They are good for structured data, complex relationships, and data integrity.  Example:  A banking system (transactions, accounts).
        *   **NoSQL Databases:**  Can have a flexible schema and are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.  Examples include document databases (like MongoDB), key-value stores, and graph databases. They are often chosen for scalability and speed in specific use cases. Example: A social media platform (posts, user profiles).

3.  **Question:** What are primary keys and foreign keys in a relational database, and why are they important?
    *   **Answer:**
        *   **Primary Key:** A unique identifier for each row (record) in a table. It ensures data integrity and is used to uniquely identify each row.  (e.g., a customer ID).
        *   **Foreign Key:** A field in one table that refers to the primary key in another table. It establishes a relationship between the two tables.  (e.g., a `customer_id` in an `orders` table that links to the `customers` table).
        *   **Importance:**  They ensure data consistency and allow you to relate data across multiple tables, forming relationships (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many).

4.  **Question:** What is normalization in database design? Why is it used?
    *   **Answer:** Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves breaking down large tables into smaller, more manageable tables and defining relationships between them. It aims to minimize data duplication, reduce storage space, and make it easier to maintain the data.  It's used to prevent update anomalies and ensure data consistency.

**Practical Questions (SQL Examples):**

5.  **Question:**  You have a table named `Customers` with the following columns: `CustomerID`, `FirstName`, `LastName`, `City`. Write a SQL query to select all customers who live in the city of "New York".
    *   **Answer (SQL Example):**

        ```sql
        SELECT *
        FROM Customers
        WHERE City = 'New York';
        ```

6.  **Question:** You have a table named `Orders` with the following columns: `OrderID`, `CustomerID`, `OrderDate`, `TotalAmount`. Write a SQL query to find the total amount spent by each customer.
    *   **Answer (SQL Example):**

        ```sql
        SELECT CustomerID, SUM(TotalAmount) AS TotalSpent
        FROM Orders
        GROUP BY CustomerID;
        ```

7.  **Question:**  Describe what this SQL query does:
    ```sql
    SELECT p.ProductName, c.CategoryName
    FROM Products p
    JOIN Categories c ON p.CategoryID = c.CategoryID;
    ```
    *   **Answer:** This SQL query retrieves the product name and category name from two tables: `Products` and `Categories`. It joins the two tables using the `CategoryID` column, which is assumed to be a foreign key in the `Products` table referencing the primary key in the `Categories` table. The query effectively shows which products belong to which categories.

8.  **Question:**  What is the purpose of the `JOIN` clause in SQL? Explain different types of JOINs (e.g., INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN).
    *   **Answer:** The `JOIN` clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.
        *   **INNER JOIN:** Returns only rows that have matching values in *both* tables based on the join condition.
        *   **LEFT (OUTER) JOIN:** Returns all rows from the "left" table (the table listed before `LEFT JOIN`) and the matching rows from the "right" table. If there is no match in the right table, `NULL` values are returned for the right table's columns.
        *   **RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN:** Similar to `LEFT JOIN`, but returns all rows from the "right" table and matching rows from the "left" table.
        *   **FULL (OUTER) JOIN:** Returns all rows when there is a match in *either* the left or the right table.

## Software engineering concepts

**Conceptual Questions:**

1.  **Question:** What is version control, and why is it important in software development? What is a popular version control system?
    *   **Answer:** Version control (also known as source control) is a system that tracks changes to code over time. It allows developers to collaborate effectively, revert to previous versions of the code, and manage different branches or versions of the software. A popular version control system is Git.

2.  **Question:** Describe the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Briefly explain the common phases.
    *   **Answer:** The SDLC is a framework that describes the steps involved in planning, designing, building, testing, and deploying software. Common phases include:
        *   **Planning/Requirements:**  Defining the project scope, goals, and requirements.
        *   **Design:**  Creating the architecture, user interface, and database design.
        *   **Implementation/Coding:** Writing the actual code.
        *   **Testing:**  Verifying that the software meets the requirements and works correctly (unit, integration, system, user acceptance testing).
        *   **Deployment:**  Releasing the software to users.
        *   **Maintenance:**  Providing ongoing support, fixing bugs, and making updates.

3.  **Question:** Explain the concept of unit testing. Why is it important?
    *   **Answer:** Unit testing involves testing individual components (units) of code in isolation. This could be testing individual functions, methods, or classes. It's important because it helps you find bugs early in the development process, makes it easier to debug code, and allows you to refactor and change your code with greater confidence.

4.  **Question:** What is an API (Application Programming Interface)? Give an example of how an API might be used.
    *   **Answer:** An API is a set of rules and specifications that software programs can use to communicate with each other. It defines how different software components or systems can request and exchange data or functionality.
        *   **Example:**  A weather application uses a weather API (like OpenWeatherMap) to retrieve weather data (temperature, conditions, etc.) for a specific location. The application sends a request to the API, which returns the weather data in a structured format (e.g., JSON).

5.  **Question:** What are the benefits of code commenting?
    *   **Answer:** Code commenting helps in a number of ways:
        *   **Readability:** Clarifies the purpose of code sections, improving understanding.
        *   **Maintainability:** Makes it easier to modify and debug code later on.
        *   **Collaboration:** Helps other developers understand your code.
        *   **Documentation:** Serves as a form of documentation for your code.

**Practical Questions (Scenario/Design):**

6.  **Question:** You are tasked with creating a simple website to display a list of products.  Describe, at a high level, the different components you would need (frontend, backend, database).  What technologies might you use for each?
    *   **Answer:**
        *   **Frontend (Client-side):**  Responsible for the user interface and interacting with the user.
            *   **Technologies:** HTML (structure), CSS (styling), JavaScript (for interactivity, data fetching).
        *   **Backend (Server-side):**  Responsible for handling requests, processing data, and interacting with the database.
            *   **Technologies:**  A programming language like Python (with a framework like Django or Flask), Node.js (with Express), Java (with Spring), or C# (.NET).
        *   **Database:**  Stores the product data.
            *   **Technologies:**  MySQL, PostgreSQL (SQL databases), MongoDB (NoSQL database).

7.  **Question:** You are working on a team project.  Describe the steps you would take to integrate a new feature into the existing codebase using Git.
    *   **Answer (Example, assuming a basic Git workflow):**
        1.  **Fetch and Pull:**  Make sure your local repository is up-to-date with the remote repository.
            ```bash
            git fetch origin
            git pull origin main  # or 'master' if that's the branch name
            ```
        2.  **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch for your feature to isolate your changes.
            ```bash
            git checkout -b feature/new-feature
            ```
        3.  **Make Changes:**  Write the code for the new feature.
        4.  **Stage Changes:** Add the modified files to the staging area.
            ```bash
            git add .  # or specific files
            ```
        5.  **Commit Changes:** Commit the changes with a descriptive message.
            ```bash
            git commit -m "Add new feature: [brief description]"
            ```
        6.  **Push Changes:** Push your branch to the remote repository.
            ```bash
            git push origin feature/new-feature
            ```
        7.  **Create a Pull Request:**  On the remote repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab), create a pull request to merge your branch into the main branch (e.g., `main` or `master`).
        8.  **Code Review:**  Have your code reviewed by another team member.
        9.  **Merge:** Once the code review is complete and approved, merge your branch into the main branch.
        10. **Pull and Delete Branch:** Pull the changes back to your local repository and delete your local feature branch (optional).
            ```bash
            git checkout main
            git pull origin main
            git branch -d feature/new-feature
            ```

8.  **Question:** What are the different types of testing?
    *   **Answer:**
        *   **Unit Testing:** Testing individual units of code (functions, methods, classes) in isolation.
        *   **Integration Testing:** Testing the interaction between different components or modules of the software.
        *   **System Testing:** Testing the entire system as a whole to ensure it meets the specified requirements.
        *   **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Testing performed by end-users to determine if the software is acceptable for release.
        *   **Regression Testing:** Re-running tests after code changes to ensure that existing functionality is not broken.
        *   **Performance Testing:** Testing the speed, responsiveness, and stability of the software under various loads.
        *   **Security Testing:** Identifying vulnerabilities in the software that could be exploited by attackers.

9.  **Question:** You are assigned to a team that uses Agile methodology. Describe what this is, and what are some of its core principles.
    *   **Answer:**
        *   **Agile methodology** is an iterative approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and continuous improvement. It prioritizes delivering working software frequently through short cycles (sprints).

        *   **Core principles:**
            *   **Customer collaboration over contract negotiation:** Focus on working closely with the customer throughout the development process.
            *   **Responding to change over following a plan:** Embrace change and be prepared to adapt to new requirements.
            *   **Individuals and interactions over processes and tools:** Value the contributions of individuals and the importance of communication.
            *   **Working software over comprehensive documentation:** Deliver working software frequently and focus on the user's perspective.
            *   **Simplicity:** Focus on delivering the essential features.
            *   **Self-organizing teams:** Allow the team to organize themselves to deliver the best results.

**Important Notes for the Test:**

*   **Adapt the difficulty:** Adjust the complexity of the questions based on the experience level you expect from a Junior Developer.
*   **Specify language/tools:**  If you have a preferred programming language or set of tools, specify that in the question instructions (e.g., "Write your code in Python...").
*   **Provide Context:** Give context where necessary. (e.g. The customer wants a website to display a list of products).
*   **Code Quality:** When evaluating code, consider:
    *   **Correctness:** Does the code produce the correct output?
    *   **Readability:** Is the code well-formatted and easy to understand?
    *   **Efficiency:** Is the code reasonably efficient (avoiding unnecessary loops, etc.)?  (This might be less critical for a junior level).
    *   **Error Handling:**  Does the code handle potential errors gracefully? (e.g., for the array example, does it handle an empty array?).
*   **Clear Expectations:** Make it clear how the test will be graded.
*   **Time limits:** Keep it realistic.
